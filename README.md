# DiamondHacks 2024 Project

A project created during DiamondHacks, ACM@UCSD's hackathon! Made by May Hong, Markus Grundler, Spencer Cowles, and Daniel Bonkowsky

## Overview

Our project aims to revolutionize e-commerce search by building a web scraping and semantic search system. Using sites like Etsy as an example, we scrape product listings and enable natural language search capabilities. Rather than traditional keyword matching, users can describe what they're looking for in everyday language, and our system understands the semantic meaning to find the most relevant products. This makes product discovery more intuitive and accessible for online shoppers.
