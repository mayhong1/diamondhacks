# DiamondHacks 2025 Project

A project created during DiamondHacks, ACM@UCSD's hackathon! Made by May Hong, Markus Gruendler, Spencer Cowles, and Daniel Bonkowsky

## Overview

If you search up "not red shirts" on Amazon.com, you are presented with a bunch of red shirts. Traditional keyword search for e-commerce has it flaws, such as with the red shirt case--it sees the keyword "red" and consequently shows items with "red" in it. 

Our project aims to revolutionize e-commerce search by building a negation-compatible semantic search system. Using sites like Amazon as an example, we gather product listings and utilize natural language search capabilities. Rather than traditional keyword matching, users can describe what they're looking for in everyday language, and our system understands the semantic meaning to find the most relevant products. This makes product discovery more intuitive and accessible for online shoppers.

Our e-commerce semantic search engine lets people search with natural language. Here's who benefits:
- Elderly or young children people who don't understand that you need to type like a robot to perform searches
- Forgetful people who don't remember the name of a product, but can describe it as "device that heats up bread"
- People who prefer to search by dictation such as those with disabilities
